The first two of your friends have a 1/2 chance of telling you the truth and, the other two have 1/4 chance of messing with you by lying. All 4 friends tell you that \"No\" it isn't raining.

The list 'answer_b' contained three 'truth's and one 'lie' since the third and fourth friend have a 1/4 chance of lying. 'answer_a' is then randomly shuffled and the first item of the list is selected to represent the truth value of the first friend's answer, and this process was then repeated for the second friend. For the third and fourth friend, the same process was repeated except with 'answer_b' instead of 'answer_a'.\n",

If one of the friends is in fact lying, then a value of 1 is added to an object named 'rain', but if all three friends are telling the truth, then a value of 1 is added to an object named 'no_rain'.\n",

        "Starting out, I decided to calculate the total distance it would take Mad Max to travel each of the gour possible routes. There are two routes he can take leaving out of Nashville, and two routes he could take leading out of Atlanta. These distances were calculated by summing the miles from NY-NVL-STL-DAL, NY-NVL-NOLA-DAL, NY-ATL-STL-DAL, and NY-ATL-NOLA-DAL. The list 'total_nvl' represents the total distances of the two possible trips Mad Max can take from NY-DAL when he chooses to head towards Nashville from New York. The list 'total_atl' represents the total distances of the two possible trips Mad Max can take from NY-DAL when he chooses to head towards Atlanta from New York.\n",

        "'q' represents the random choice of whether or not Max decides to head towrds either Nashville or Atlanta when he departs from New York, as he does not know which roads will be blocked before he reaches either of these two cities. If 'q' == 0, Max will head towards Nashville, if 'q' == 1, Max will head towards Atlanta. 'c' represents the random road that will be blocked when Max leaves from either Nashville or Atlanta. After Max arrives in either Nashville or Atlanta, one of the routes from the two possible routes he can take will be removed, and the total trip distance of the remaining route will be appended to an empty list (either 'atl_trips' if Max went from NY-ATL, or 'nvl_trips' if Max went from NY-NVL).\n",
